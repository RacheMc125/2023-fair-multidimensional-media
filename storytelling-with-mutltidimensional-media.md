During this exercise you will curate a story bringing together multidimensional 
media using [Exhibit](https://www.exhibit.so/) tool.

The example below shows a story of the Kinora, which was an 
early motion picture device developed by the French inventors Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re 
in 1895. 

The story brings together images, videos and 3D models to illustrate the
history of these artefacts, their context and mechanics. The media 
with which this story as developed is available [here](https://data.d4science.org/workspace-explorer-app?folderId=MUVkZVY5L1hRYnV4ZzJiUVljVlk5U1hmOHZYaDQ1SGVZT0l6aUZGa2lEclVFT0ppWEo4VDRzU2Z0alNiSk5GTg).

## Developing a story in Exhibit
Using the dataset of multidimensional data
which you previously curated, the task is 
to create a story which brings all of this together.


Use the tutorial Exhibit website: [https://exhibit-culturedigitalskills.vercel.app/](https://exhibit-culturedigitalskills.vercel.app/)
