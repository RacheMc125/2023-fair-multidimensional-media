**Multi-dimensional** media is a term which 
covers various types of non-textual data.
It is often used to refer to 
representational and derivative media created through
digitisation processes or synthetic 
images produced via software. These processes often result in multi-part,
multi-format and, often, large 
project files which describe the creation process.
